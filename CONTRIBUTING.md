## Pull Requests Reviews

This is a simple guide to assist in reviewing Github pull requests locally within VS Code.

See: https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247
Locate the section for your github remote in the `.git/config` file. It looks like this:

```
[remote "origin"]
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	url = git@github.com:joyent/node.git
```

Now add the line `fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*` to this section. Obviously, change the github url to match your project's URL. It ends up looking like this:

```
[remote "origin"]
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	url = git@github.com:joyent/node.git
	fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
```

Now fetch all the pull requests:

```
$ git fetch origin
From github.com:joyent/node
 * [new ref]         refs/pull/1000/head -> origin/pr/1000
 * [new ref]         refs/pull/1002/head -> origin/pr/1002
 * [new ref]         refs/pull/1004/head -> origin/pr/1004
 * [new ref]         refs/pull/1009/head -> origin/pr/1009
...
```

To check out a particular pull request:

```
$ git checkout pr/999
Branch pr/999 set up to track remote branch pr/999 from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'pr/999'
```

To get latest changes to the PR:

```
$ git checkout pr/1000
$ git pull --tags origin refs/pull/1000/head
From https://github.com/microsoft/angular-react
 * branch            refs/pull/1000/head -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating aab92e2..2896b73
Fast-forward
...
```

Note: "git pull" did not work for me by itself for the PR branch... Perhaps "git pull origin".
